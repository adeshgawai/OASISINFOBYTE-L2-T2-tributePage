                        Dr. Vikram Sarabhai is considered the father of the Indian space program. He was a great
                        institution builder and helped in establishing a large number of institutions in diverse fields.
                        After returning from Cambridge in 1947, he requested his friends and family members to help him
                        in opening a research institution near his home in Ahmedabad, thus at the age of only 28, he
                        founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad on November 11, 1947.

                        The Physical Research Laboratory was the first of many institutions which Vikram Sarabhai
                        created and cultivated. He served in the Physical Research Laboratory from 1966 to 1971.

                        Vikram Sarabhai was also very active in his family’s industry and the business which it had.
                        After Independence in 1947, Vikram Sarabhai founded the Ahmedabad Textile Industry’s Research
                        Association and then actively looked after it until 1956. Seeing the immediate need for
                        management professionals in the country, Vikram Sarabhai also helped in setting up the Indian
                        Institute of Management at Ahmedabad in 1962.

                        The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) which was later renamed the Indian
                        Space Research Organization(ISRO) was established by Vikram Sarabhai in 1962.

                        After the death of the beloved physicist Homi Bhabha in 1966, Vikram Sarabhai was appointed as
                        the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. He is also credited for setting up the
                        Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station in Southern India. Vikram Sarabhai also helped in
                        developing indigenous nuclear technology for defence.

                        The establishment of the Indian space research organization by Vikram Sarabhai is considered to
                        be his greatest achievement. When he returned to India after completing his Doctorate from
                        Cambridge University in London in 1947, he was able to convince the newly formed independent
                        Indian government of the importance of a space program for a developing country like India. Dr.
                        Sarabhai was also supported by Dr. Homi Jehangir Bhabha who is widely regarded as the father of
                        the Indian nuclear science program. He supported Dr. Sarabhai in setting the first rocket launch
                        station in India. At Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram on the coast of the Arabian sea, the first
                        rocket launch centre was established

                        The inaugural flight was launched on November 21, 1963, with sodium vapour payload after a
                        remarkable effort in setting up the infrastructure, personnel, communication links, and launch
                        pads.

                        Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was constantly in negotiations with the other leading country’s space
                        organization such as NASA and because of his efforts, the Satellite Instructional Television
                        Experiment (SITE) was launched during July 1975 - July 1976.</p>
