                        Ratan Tata was born in 1937 in Mumbai to one of the wealthiest business families in India, the
                        Tata
                        Group, which helped India’s industrialization after independence. He earned a management degree
                        from
                        Harvard University after studying architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University
                        in
                        the United States.

                        Despite becoming the future chairman of Tata Group, he began his career with blue-collar workers
                        in
                        the Tata Steel Division. In 1971, He was named Director-in-Charge of the National Radio and
                        Electronics Company Limited (NELCO) when it was in desperate need of a resurrection, and he
                        turned
                        it around.

                        He took over the leadership of Tata Group in 1990, ushering in a slew of reforms to modernize
                        the
                        group’s business operations in order to compete successfully in the new era. During his tenure,
                        he
                        merged all Tata firms, purchased other companies such as Tetley and Jaguar Land Rover, and
                        floated
                        Tata Motors on the New York Stock Exchange, earning the company international acclaim.

                        Under his leadership, India acquired its first indigenously built automobile, the ‘Indica,’ as
                        well
                        as its first tiny car, the ‘Nano.’ The Nano is the world’s most economic automobile by Tata, who
                        was
                        thoughtful for the safety of nuclear families riding on two-wheelers.

                        Ratan Naval Tata was chairman of the Tata Group until his retirement in 2012, after which he
                        served
                        as temporary chairman in 2017. The industrialist has received two of the highest accolades given
                        by
                        the Indian government, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan.

                        Apart from Corus Group, one of Ratan Tata’s most notable accomplishments was taking the Tata
                        brand
                        global through acquisitions such as Tetley Tea, Daewoo Motors’ truck manufacturing subsidiary,
                        and
                        Jaguar Land Rover.

                        TCS, an IT services business, went public in 2004 under Ratan Tata’s leadership. Tata Motors,
                        the
                        automaker, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under Ratan Tata’s reign. Tata’s
                        contribution
                        to India’s car sector has been a feather in his cap, with the group building a true-blue Indian
                        brand, the Indica, followed by the Nano, which was his own creation. During his tenure, the Tata
                        Group’s revenues and net earnings more than doubled.

                        Ratan Tata had a significant task when he met with Ford executives to sell the Tata Group’s
                        vehicle
                        division. The acquisition did not go through, but Tata fought to improve the car industry. When
                        Ford
                        was on the verge of bankruptcy nine years later, Tata was able to secure the company’s Jaguar
                        Land
                        Rover purchase for more than $2 billion. During the 26/11 terror attacks, he spearheaded efforts
                        to
                        assist casualties outside the Taj hotel, demonstrating his ability to overcome obstacles.
